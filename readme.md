A simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors I designed and programmed using vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>.

### Notes

I had a lot of fun writing this‚Ä¶ though there was this one time I was *exhausted* and wanted to finish writing a particular **for-dEach** function in the script but my brain woudn't allow me to. I spent over an hour messing with code, erasing eveything and starting over a few times. My mind went blank and everything else I had written looked foreign to me lol but instead of taking a nap‚Ä¶ I made some **ocha** (green tea in Japanese) and stood outside in 34 degree NYC weather in a t-shirt for a few minutes, came back, and fortunately figured it out pretty quickly. It's my favorite code snippet from the project (see below üòÖ). The snippet determines which animation to run depending on whether or not the player *and* bot made the same choice in the round of the game. If any round results in a tie, the image of the computers choice is translated a few pixels upwards, rotated 360deg, then is translated back down. Otherwise the image would just be rotated, sin translation. 
Anyway‚Ä¶ I hope you like it lol, k thanks bye ‚úåüèΩ
